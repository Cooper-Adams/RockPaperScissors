Rock Paper Scissors is now fully functioning with a gui on the page, and no longer uses alerts to get user input. User will click one of the rock, paper, or scissors buttons to play, and will be told the result of the game, with the scoreboard updating to reflect it. Once five games have been played, the user will have to refresh to play again.
